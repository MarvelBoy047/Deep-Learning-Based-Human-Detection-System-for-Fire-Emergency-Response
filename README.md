# Deep-Learning-Based-Human-Detection-System-for-Fire-Emergency-Response

The objective is to implement human detection during fire emergencies using deep learning algorithms via a drone-mounted camera. Between 2010 and 2014, 113,961 people died in fire accidents in India, with Maharashtra accounting for 21.3% of the fatalities. Firefighters often struggle to locate and identify individuals trapped in smoke-filled environments, leading to avoidable deaths. The proposed solution involves deploying a drone equipped with a camera to detect humans using deep learning algorithms. It will identify faces to recognize individuals and analyze body postures to assess their condition, enabling better rescue prioritization and reducing casualties.

Technology Stack Components:

1. Deep Learning Framework:
TensorFlow or PyTorch: For training and deploying the deep learning models such as CNNs.
2. Computer Vision Algorithms:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For detecting human features like faces, bodies, and postures.
Single Shot Detection (SSD): For real-time face detection in smoke-filled or low-visibility environments.
Pose Estimation Networks (e.g., OpenPose, MediaPipe): For detecting and analyzing human body postures to assess trapped individuals' conditions.
3. Image/Video Processing Tools:
OpenCV: For video stream processing and real-time image analysis.
YOLO (You Only Look Once): As an alternative for object detection, due to its fast real-time performance.
4. Data Management and Storage:
Database (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase): For storing drone video feeds, human detection results, and rescue status information.
